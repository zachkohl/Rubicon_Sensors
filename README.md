# Rubicon_Sensors_0-2
This is the Python Flask app that I built to demonstrate the minimum viable product potential for the startup I was involved in called Rubicon Sensors. 

The idea was to offer remote water monitoring services to well owners in rural environments. The business model anticipated certain regulatory developments that never materialized. But it was a great learning opportunity and got me really excited about website programming. 

Since completing this project, I have moved a lot of my programming attention to NodeJS. The project also involved a lot of more traditional electrical engineering, which if you are interested in learning more about I would be happy to share details with you. 

This was my first project that did anything intersting. Please understand this when looking at it.
