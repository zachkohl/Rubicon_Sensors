To run this program, get yourself a python vitual dev going.

With python 3.6 installed,

Go to the desired folder and type: python -m venv VIRTUAL_ENV
This creates a folder called VIRTUAL_ENV inside whatever folder you where just at. Navigate to VIRTUAL_ENV/Scripts. Then type activate. 
This will activate the virtual environment. You can tell because the command line now has (VIRTUAL_ENV) in it. 
Everything in this virtual invironment is now in your path. All pip commands will install packages to this virtual environment and not globally. 

To deactivate and return to normal, just type "deactivate" at anytime. 

NEXT:
Return to the git repository folder containing all the Rubicon Sensors stuff. Should be the folder this text message is in. 
Run: pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the python dependencies. 

Make sure your MYSQL database is up and running. Your data must be in databaseURI.txt located in the static folder. the databaseURI.txt is listed in the .gitignore, so it is 
pecific to each machine. 


Run the local server by running: app.py



If you want to add a package, just use pip install PACKAGE NAME
Afterwards run pip freeze > requirements.txt 
This will update the requirements file, allowing other editors, and production, to get the same system running.
