Go to the desired folder and type: python -m venv VIRTUAL_ENV
This creates a folder called VIRTUAL_ENV inside whatever folder you where just at. Navigate to VIRTUAL_ENV/Scripts. Then type activate. 
This will activate the virtual environment. You can tell because the command line now has (VIRTUAL_ENV) in it. 
Everything in this virtual invironment is now in your path. All pip commands will install packages to this virtual environment and not globally. 

To deactivate and return to normal, just type "deactivate" at anytime.

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the python dependencies.
